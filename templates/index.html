            <ol>
                <li><h2>Clear Browser Cache</h2>
                    <p>HTML will probably update when changes have been made to an HTML document but
                    CSS changes will likely be cached. This can be frustrating to resolve because
                    it seems like the updates are incorrect when the page is refreshed and CSS
                    changes are not displaying. This also happens when updating the routes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Make an Outline</h2>
                    <p>It is easier to separate the development process into compartmental efforts.
                    Creating page content, deciding page layout, and creating code for the web
                    server to run should be focused on independently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Source Control</h2>
                    <p>The other labs were easy to create code backups while working by simply making
                    a copy of the .py script and changing the name. Since the flask environment relies
                    on a specific file structure, it's important to save all the objects that have
                    been changed as well as any changes to the directory structure. Maybe setting up a
                    github project is the way to go; I have just been making a copy of the entire folder
                    so far.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Practice Examples</h2>
                    <p>It's best to do each of the walk through examples for a concept, like the template
                     blocks, separately and save those off for reference in another project rather than
                     trying to start a lab and incorporate the new technique at the same time. </p>
